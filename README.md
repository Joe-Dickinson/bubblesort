BubbleSort
==========

A skeleton app and test for the bubble sort algorithm.

# Install

1. Fork this repo
2. git clone your own copy to your projects folder.
3. cd ~/projects/BubbleSort

# TODO

Use this to convert your work in progress from earlier to implement a sorting algorithm.

If you've previously had something like this:

to_sort = [5, 1, 4, 5, 8]

You need to replace all occurences of to_sort with self, if you are going to package your code inside of a custom Array article.

Secondly, as of now the test will fail. This is good, as in TDD we like to specify how the program works first, see the test fail, then add the implementation. So you need to finish your implementation so that the test passes!

# To run

```ruby my_amazing_test.rb```

# Submission

Once you're done, push your code to your repo and send me a pull request.
